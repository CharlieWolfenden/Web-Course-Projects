    <p>
        You are teleported to a tiny patch of rock within a sea of shimmering sapphires.<br>
        At the edge of the rock, you see two plynths carved from stone.<br>
        On the left is a sculpture of a grand crown, on the right a sculpture of a shining sword.<br>
        What shall be your chosen destiny?
