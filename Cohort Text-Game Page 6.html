    <p>
        You are teleported to a tiny patch of rock within a sea of shimmering sapphires.<br>
        At the edge of the rock, you see two plynths carved from stone.<br>
        On the left is a sculpture of an opened book, on the right is a sculpture of a blacksmith's hammer.<br>
        What shall be your chosen destiny?
